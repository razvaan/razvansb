# razvanSB
a heavily-moderated and restricted ROBLOX script builder.

### how do i upload the latest release to roblox as a game?
download the latest RBXM release and insert its contents into `ServerScriptService`. make sure `workspace` is cleared of any possible map objects as razvanSB already has its own map stored in `rsb_init.server_dependencies.map`.

### documentation?
the documentation can be found [here](https://razvansb.gitbook.io/razvansb-docs/).

### other stuff
the code may be hard to read since i didnt originally intend to make it open-source. if you got any questions, feel free to dm me on discord (_razvaan).
